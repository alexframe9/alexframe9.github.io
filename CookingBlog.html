        <h2>Easy Weeknight Meals</h2>
        <p>To save some money (and eat healthier), I've started cooking a lot more. My go-to grocery store is Trader Joe's, but I'll occasionally stop by Whole Foods. Here are a few simple recipes I make all the time.</p>

        <h3>Greek Chicken Bowls</h3>
        <p>This is a versatile meal that's great for meal prep. You can customize the toppings based on what you have.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook chicken breast and season with oregano, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Prepare a base of quinoa or rice.</li>
            <li>Top with chopped cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and feta cheese.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with tzatziki sauce.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Quick Taco Bowls</h3>
        <p>Faster and often healthier than regular tacos. This comes together in about 20 minutes.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Brown some ground beef or turkey with taco seasoning.</li>
            <li>Warm up a can of black beans and some frozen corn.</li>
            <li>Serve the meat, beans, and corn over a bed of lettuce or rice.</li>
            <li>Add your favorite toppings: salsa, shredded cheese, avocado, or sour cream.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Trader Joe's Chicken Shawarma</h3>
        <p>This one is <em>incredibly</em> easy because Trader Joe's does all the hard work of marinating the chicken.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Saut√© the Trader Joe's pre-marinated chicken shawarma in a pan until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Warm up some pita bread or naan.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken with a side of hummus, garlic spread, and a simple cucumber-tomato salad.</li>
        </ol>
