        <p>There are only a few good months for golf here in Wisconsin, so I'm trying to make the most of them. I've been going with friends to a local course called The Glen and have been having a blast.</p>
        
        <h2>Getting Serious</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy my own set of vintage Wilson clubs. Having my own gear has made a huge difference, and I think it's already paying off. Last time I was out, I got my first ever birdie, which was an awesome moment!</p>

        <h2>Next on the List</h2>
        <p>While I love The Glen, I want to explore more of the public courses around the city before the season ends. Here are the next few places I plan to play:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The Bridges Golf Course</li>
            <li>Monona Golf Course</li>
            <li>Yahara Hills Golf Course</li>
        </ul>
