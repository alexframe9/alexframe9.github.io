    <main>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my site. I am a fifth year Aerospace Engineering student at UW-Madison. Throughout my time here I've gotten to work on some cool projects, a few of which are linked above.</p>
        
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of my coursework, I spend my time exploring a few key hobbies:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Skiing:</strong> I haven't much experience, but I recently bought my first pair of skis. I'll be posting about trips, and little things I learn along the way,</li>
            <li><strong>Golf:</strong> There's only a few months of good golf weather up here in Madison, but I'll be posting my scores and some tips while I can.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> To save some money I've been forced to pick up cooking. Follow along to learn new recipes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>External Resources</h2>
        <p>For anyone interested in aerospace, I highly recommend visiting the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA website</a> for the latest news and discoveries.</p>
